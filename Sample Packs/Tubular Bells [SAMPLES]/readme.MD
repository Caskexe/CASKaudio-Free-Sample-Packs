This was a fun opportunity. Sampling tubular bells! The sustain on these things was fairly insane! I tapped each bell with roughly the same amount of force (chime hammer).

The 18 bells go from C1 to F2. 
They were recorded in Mono using a Shure SM57 with a FETHEAD Preamp. Recorded at 24-bit, 48kHz.
A small amount of post-production was done to remove any background or electrical noise. 
A short fadeout has been applied. 
All recordings were normalised to -3 dB without limiting or compression added.
